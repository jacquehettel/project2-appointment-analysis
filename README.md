# Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree - Project #2 - Investigating a Dataset

## Overview
The second project in the Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree Program asks students to select one of multiple datasets to demonstrate their skills in cleaning and performing exploratory investigations of data. We are then asked to write up and share our findings.

For this project, I selected a dataset that contains information on medical appointment scheduling and attendance behaviors of over 100,000 individual appointments in Brazil.
