# Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree - Project #2 - Investigating a Dataset

## Overview
The second project in the Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree Program asks students to select one of multiple datasets to demonstrate their skills in cleaning and performing exploratory investigations of data. We are then asked to write up and share our findings.

For this project, I selected a dataset containing over 100,000 information records regarding medical appointment scheduling and attendance behaviors in Brazil. After performing cleaning tasks on the data, I then crafted a series of research questions about the data and investigated them. These findings can be found in the Jupyter notebook within this repository.

## Repository Contents
This repository contains the following files:

1. An HTML version of my final Jupyter Notebook;
2. The .ipynb Jupyter Notebook file for executing my Python scripts; and
3. The CSV file that contains the project data.
